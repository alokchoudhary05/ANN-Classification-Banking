# Customer Loyalty Turnover Forecasting (Artificial Neural Network Model) 

Customer Loyalty Turnover Forecasting is an advanced machine learning and deep learning project aimed at predicting customer turnover with high accuracy. By analyzing historical data and customer behavior patterns, the model identifies at-risk customers, empowering businesses to make informed decisions and implement effective retention strategies.

The project leverages cutting-edge technologies, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and TensorFlow, to deliver robust predictions. The system is designed for scalability and ease of deployment, ensuring seamless integration into business workflows. An interactive web application built with Streamlit enables real-time predictions and actionable insights for users.
